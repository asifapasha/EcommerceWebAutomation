# EcommerceWebAutomation
This framework is built from scratch for practice purpose.I have implemented the framework with the help of Java,  Selenium,  Page Object Model, Junit, BDD, Cucumber report, Maven etc on a demo web application called as "http://automationpractice.com/index.php".

The aim of this project is to write feature file, develop scenrios and execute end to end test automation scripts in an CI/CD environment.

I have also tried to achieve parallel execution of the scripts to make execution faster.

In future the tests can also be run on cross browsing platforms.
